1) Confirm public SSH blocked for cluster nodes (from AdminPC):
- ControlPlane01 public: ssh ops@165.227.45.55 -> expected FAIL
- WorkerNode01 public:   ssh ops@159.203.10.8  -> expected FAIL
- AppServer01 public:    ssh ops@142.93.154.5  -> expected FAIL

2) Confirm private SSH OK (from VPN / ToolServer01):
- ssh ops@10.118.0.2 -> expected OK
- ssh ops@10.118.0.6 -> expected OK

Status:
- Confirmed by operator: CP/Worker/AppServer01 cannot be accessed by public SSH; ToolServer01 VPN OK.
